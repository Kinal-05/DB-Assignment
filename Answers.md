Answer 1:
The "Product" entity and "Product_Category" entity have a one-to-many relationship in the diagram. Each product belongs to one product category, while a product category can have multiple products associated with it.

One Product - Many Categories: A single product can belong to one product category. There is a foreign key called category_id in the "Product" table that references the primary key (id) of the "Product_Category" table. This foreign key constraint enforces that each product has a category assigned.
One Product Category - Many Products: A single product category can have many products associated with it. The "Product_Category" table likely doesn't have a foreign key referencing the "Product" table.


Answer 2:
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it:
1. Make the category_id column in the "Product" table NOT NULL. A NOT NULL constraint on a column enforces that the column cannot contain null values. This would prevent products from being saved without a category assigned.

2. Set a default value for the category_id column in the "Product" table. A default value specifies the value that will be automatically inserted into a column if no value is provided during data entry. This would ensure that every product has a category assigned, even if it's not the most specific category.
